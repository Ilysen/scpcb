The rebalanced version of the game, downloadable from the `rebalance` branch, intends to fix a plethora of major issues with balance and pacing that the game has. The goal is primarily to make the game fairer and less cumbersome on the player, but also to make the game more canonically accurate, drift it more towards the actual Foundation's lore, and polish it across the board.

A full list of changes includes:
* SCP-914 now refines cards linearly on Fine and Very Fine, with no regard to achievements.
* If the intro sequence is disabled, you don't start with a leaflet or 173 document.
* You can put SCP-714 into the wallet.
* The wallet can now be upgraded through SCP-914 like the clipboard.
* SCP-427 has been strongly buffed.
* You don't have to re-enable the secondary lighting multiple times in a short period if 079 turns it off and you quickly flick it back on.
* The default horizontal FOV is now set to 90 degrees.
* Key Cards have been renamed to Keycards.
* Changed a lot of messages to present tense instead of past tense. (i.e. "You called the elevator." -> "You call the elevator.")
* SCP-173 no longer spawns in SCP-049's containment chamber, but the 049-2 zombies start active and moving.
* Changed several loading screens to be more canonically accurate.
* SCP-173 no longer opens doors.
* Running yourself through 914 on Fine has different effects.
* New sounds for blast doors, elevators, glass breaking, and other things.
* Light Containment storage rooms can spawn eyedrops, and higher level keycards.
* Very Fine night vision goggles have been reworked.
